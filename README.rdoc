== DESCRIPTION:

Manages persistent connections using Net::HTTP plus a speed fix for Ruby 1.8.
It's thread-safe too!

Using persistent HTTP connections can dramatically increase the speed of HTTP.
Creating a new HTTP connection for every request involves an extra TCP
round-trip and causes TCP congestion avoidance negotiation to start over.

Net::HTTP supports persistent connections with some API methods but does not
handle reconnection gracefully.  Net::HTTP::Persistent supports reconnection
and retry according to RFC 2616.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Supports SSL
* Thread-safe
* Pure ruby
* Timeout-less speed boost for Ruby 1.8 (by Aaron Patterson)

== SYNOPSIS

The following example will make two requests to the same server.  The
connection is kept alive between requests:

    require 'net/http/persistent'
    
    uri = URI 'http://example.com/awesome/web/service'
    
    http = Net::HTTP::Persistent.new 'my_app_name'
    
    # perform a GET
    response = http.request uri
    
    # create a POST
    post_uri = uri + 'create'
    post = Net::HTTP::Post.new post_uri.path
    post.set_form_data 'some' => 'cool data'
    
    # perform the POST, the URI is always required
    response http.request post_uri, post

Please see the documentation for +Net::HTTP::Persistent+ for more information,
including how to handle SSL connections.
